Sudoku Solver
Version 1.0

Author: Ben Greene

Purpose: 
The Sudoku Solver is a program meant entirely, as the name suggests, to solve sudokus. It doesn't use brute force to solve them either, because as you can imagine, a brute force algorithm would take quite a bit of time given the vast number of possibilities the board can be arranged. 

To enter a board to solve you may either manually enter a board, or via a text file. If you enter a board via a text file however, if there is an error with the board the program will exit.
